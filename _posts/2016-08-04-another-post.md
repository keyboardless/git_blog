That's easy. Don't open source anything that represents core business value.

Here are some examples of what we don't open source and why:

* Core GitHub Rails app (easier to sell when closed)
* The Jobs Sinatra app (specially crafted integration with github.com)

Here are some examples of things we do open source and why:

* Grit (general purpose Git bindings, useful for building many tools)
* Ernie (general purpose BERT-RPC server)
* Resque (general purpose job processing)
* Jekyll (general purpose static site generator)
* Gollum (general purpose wiki app)
* Hubot (general purpose chat bot)
* Charlock_Holmes (general purpose character encoding detection)
* Albino (general purpose syntax highlighting)
* Linguist (general purpose filetype detection)
